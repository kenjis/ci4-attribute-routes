# CodeIgniter4 Attribute Routes

This package generates a **Routes File** from the **Attribute Routes** in your **Controllers**.

- You can set routes in your Controllers, and disable **Auto Routing**.
- It generates a Routes File, so, there is no extra overhead at runtime.
- The generated Routes File can be used on PHP 7.3 production servers.

```php
use Kenjis\CI4\AttributeRoutes\Route;

class SomeController extends BaseController
{
    #[Route('path', methods: ['get'])]
    public function index()
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

## Requirements

- CodeIgniter 4.3.1 or later
- Composer
- PHP 8.0 or later

## Installation

```sh-session
$ composer require kenjis/ci4-attribute-routes
```

## Configuration

1. Add the following code to the bottom of your `app/Config/Routes.php` file:
```php
/*
 * Attribute Routes
 *
 * To update the route file, run the following command:
 * $ php spark route:update
 *
 * @see https://github.com/kenjis/ci4-attribute-routes
 */
if (file_exists(APPPATH . 'Config/RoutesFromAttribute.php')) {
    require APPPATH . 'Config/RoutesFromAttribute.php';
}
```

2. Disable auto routing and enable route priority:
```diff
--- a/app/Config/Routes.php
+++ b/app/Config/Routes.php
@@ -22,7 +22,8 @@ $routes->setDefaultController('Home');
 $routes->setDefaultMethod('index');
 $routes->setTranslateURIDashes(false);
 $routes->set404Override();
-$routes->setAutoRoute(true);
+$routes->setAutoRoute(false);
+$routes->setPrioritize();
```

This is optional, but strongly recommended.

## Quick Start

### 1. Add Attribute Routes to your Controllers

Add `#[Route()]` attributes to your Controller methods.

```php
<?php
namespace App\Controllers;

use Kenjis\CI4\AttributeRoutes\Route;

class News extends BaseController
{
    #[Route('news', methods: ['get'])]
    public function index()
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

### 2. Update Routes File

```sh-session
$ php spark route:update
```

`APPPATH/Config/RoutesFromAttribute.php` is generated.

Check your routes with the `php spark routes` command.

## Route Attributes

### Route

```php
#[Route('news', methods: ['get'])]
```
```php
#[Route('news/create', methods: ['get', 'post'])]
```
```php
#[Route('news/(:segment)', methods: ['get'], options: ['priority' => 1])]
```

### RouteGroup

```php
use Kenjis\CI4\AttributeRoutes\RouteGroup;

#[RouteGroup('', options: ['filter' => 'auth'])]
class GroupController extends BaseController
{
    #[Route('group/a', methods: ['get'])]
    public function getA(): void
    {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

### RouteResource

```php
use Kenjis\CI4\AttributeRoutes\RouteResource;

#[RouteResource('photos', options: ['websafe' => 1])]
class ResourceController extends ResourceController
{
    ...
}
```

### RoutePresenter

```php
use Kenjis\CI4\AttributeRoutes\RoutePresenter;

#[RoutePresenter('presenter')]
class PresenterController extends ResourcePresenter
{
    ...
}
```

## Trouble Shooting

### No routes in the generated routes file

You must import the attribute classes in your controllers.

E.g.:
```php
use Kenjis\CI4\AttributeRoutes\Route;
...
    #[Route('news', methods: ['get'])]
    public function index()
```

### Can't be routed correctly, or 404 error occurs

Show your routes with the `php spark routes` command, and check the order of the routes.
The first matched route is the one that is executed.
The placeholders like `(.*)` or `([^/]+)` takes any characters or segment. So you have to move the routes like that to the bottom.

In one controller, you can move the methods having such routes to the bottom.

Or set the priority of the routes with `options`:
```php
#[Route('news/(:segment)', methods: ['get'], options: ['priority' => 1])]
```
Zero is the default priority, and the higher the number specified in the `priority` option, the lower route priority in the processing queue.
